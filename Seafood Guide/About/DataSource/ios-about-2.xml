			<descnews>Always ask where seafood comes from and whether it was wild-caught or farmed?  For example, choose wild-caught, or otherwise sustainably produced, domestic shrimp over imported farmed shrimp. Even if the person you ask does not know, your question will help encourage the establishment to become more knowledge about seafood sourcing.
Tell the FDA to increase inspection of imported seafood.
                
Ask Congress to increase funding and oversight for the FDAâ€™s seafood import inspection program.

Tell the USDA to expand country-of-origin labeling so that it includes processed seafood and includes every store and restaurant.</descnews>
