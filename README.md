## An iOS App Seafood Guide

The goal of this application was to provide a starter iOS application for those looking to learn how to program an iOS app. This was the project that I used while learning how to program at the Big Nerd Ranch. 

The app itself is located on the macOS App Store, again as a proof of concept and more or less as a portfolio piece.

The UI was designed in Photoshop and the App was originally coded in Objective-C and ported over to Swift. 

To Do:
- Convert to Swift UI
